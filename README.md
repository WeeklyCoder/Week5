# Week5 | Tic-Tac-Toe
Code to liven up this Egyptian game from the 1300 BC often called Tic-Tac-Toe ( O - X )!

## üìÉ Description:
Often played on a 3x3 grid, players of this game take turns marking empty squares with their respective symbols, usually X and O. The objective is to get three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The first player to achieve this wins the game. And if no winner the game is a draw. Create a simple visual of 3 x 3 grid to recreate this easy but captivating game.

## üë©‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Rules:
The rule is simple. Be the first player to get your symbol in a row.

## ‚ú® Variation:
- Why be bounded by 3 x 3 grid. Can you make it so that it can be expanded?
- Play it with a friend as a multiplayer version or with a computer in single player?
- Allow other characters/symbols than 'O' and 'X'?
- Alter the randomness and add difficulty mode in single player?

## üí° Where to start? (Ideas)
It‚Äôs always Input, Process, Output.
- To get started, use **[this](https://github.com/WeeklyCoder/Week5/blob/main/WeeklyCoder_Week5.pde)** bare minimum code.
- Let you start by understanding all there is to know about the game by playing it firsthand [here](https://g.co/kgs/edc3M7).
- Continue by deciding how to take input from user about where to place their symbol on the grid. Whether mouse action, keyboard action, input field, +.

## ü•® Twists
- What if it showed a percentage? What if it showed an estimated time? What if it fades away when loading is completed? +

## Recommended learning:
```- Multidimensional arrays```

```- random (), CASTING```

```- line (), text (), textAlign (), textSize (), +```

## ‚è≥ Submissions:
- Submission of this challenge, just like all of the Weekly Coder‚Äôs challenges, is to be within 36 hours after post. And so, [here](https://t.me/WeeklyCoder/15) Sunday morning 12:00 LT.
